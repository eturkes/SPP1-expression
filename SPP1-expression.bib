  abstract = {The developmental and molecular heterogeneity of tissue macrophages is unravelling, as are their diverse contributions to physiology and pathophysiology. Moreover, also given tissues harbor macrophages in discrete anatomic locations. Functional contributions of specific cell populations can in mice be dissected using Cre recombinase-mediated mutagenesis. However, single promoter-based Cre models show limited specificity for cell types. Focusing on macrophages in the brain, we establish here a binary transgenic system involving complementation-competent NCre and CCre fragments whose expression is driven by distinct promoters: Sall1ncre: Cx3cr1ccre mice specifically target parenchymal microglia and compound transgenic Lyve1ncre: Cx3cr1ccre animals target vasculature-associated macrophages, in the brain, as well as other tissues. We imaged the respective cell populations and retrieved their specific translatomes using the RiboTag in order to define them and analyze their differential responses to a challenge. Collectively, we establish the value of binary transgenesis to dissect tissue macrophage compartments and their functions.},

  abstract = {The mammalian nervous system executes complex behaviors controlled by specialized, precisely positioned, and interacting cell types. Here, we used RNA sequencing of half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types.},
